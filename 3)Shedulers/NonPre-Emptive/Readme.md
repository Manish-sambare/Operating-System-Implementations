# ⚙️ FCFS CPU Scheduling Simulator (C Program)

This is a simple **menu-driven C program** that simulates the **First Come First Serve (FCFS)** CPU scheduling algorithm — a **non-preemptive scheduling technique** used in Operating Systems.

## 🧠 What is FCFS Scheduling?

- **FCFS (First Come First Serve)** is the simplest CPU scheduling algorithm.
- The process that arrives **first** gets **executed first**.
- It's **non-preemptive**, meaning once a process starts, it runs till completion.

## 💻 Features

- Menu-driven interface
- Input process data: arrival time & burst time
- Simulate FCFS scheduling
- Display:
  - Waiting Time
  - Turnaround Time
  - Average Waiting & Turnaround Time

## 🔧 How to Compile & Run

### 1. Compile the program:
```bash
gcc FCFS.c -o FCFS

# ðŸ§  Process Management in C: Fork, Orphan, and Zombie Processes

This project demonstrates **process management** using `fork()` in C. It showcases how the parent and child processes operate independently and introduces two important process types: **Orphan** and **Zombie** processes.

---

## ðŸ”§ What This Code Does

### âœ… Part A: Fork and Sorting
- The **parent process** sorts a static array in **ascending order**.
- The **child process** sorts the same array in **descending order**.

### âœ… Part B: Orphan Process
- The parent exits before the child.
- The child continues executing and becomes an **orphan**, adopted by the `init` (or `systemd`) process.

### âœ… Part C: Zombie Process
- The parent does **not call `wait()`**, causing the child to become a **zombie process** after it finishes.
